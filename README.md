 I'am going CRAZY.js 👍 ```[ isNaN(null), parseInt(null), null * 1, 0 == null, 0 == null * 1 ]```
 So... is "NaN"? No...
 So I can parseInt? No... because is NaN!.
 Hmmm 0 is equal null? No, right. 
 In this way, null * 1 is 0!
 Finally, 0 == null is false but 0 == null * 1 is true while null is not a NaN but parse as NaN. WELCOME!
