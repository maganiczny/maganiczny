# Hello World.
- 👋 Hi, I’m @maganiczny

- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming (still, for over ten years), not only PHP ~~(but I want to by advanced)~~ (because I know in PHP what I need to know), I know too JS, HTML and CSS. I'am maintly full stack (web)dev but I know how works c++, Assembler, Bash/Shell, Perl, Java, Delphi and others languages. Show me language or library, give me a minute and I build something in this space. Besides, it administers its own server => this is knowledge about docker (compose), many distribution of linux and their difference structures, this is knowledge about services and administrative of server system.
